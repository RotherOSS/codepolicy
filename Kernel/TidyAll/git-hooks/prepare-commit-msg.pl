=head1 NAME

prepare-commit-msg.pl - a git hook

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This git hook preset the commit message when running I<git commit>.
Two different features are supported.

=head2 reference the Github issue based on a naming convention for the branch

When the current git branch is recognised as an issue branch then
the commit message is prepended with 'Issue #<ISSUE_ID>:'.

Examples for issue branch names are:

    issue-#513-prepare_commit_msg
    issue-rotheross/otobo#513-prepare_commit_msg
    issue-RotherOSS/otobo-docker#1-example
    issue-RotherOSS/otobo-docker#2-x


=head2 include the file .git/OTOBOCommitTemplateFile.msg

This is support for a workflow that generates text for the commit message and writes it to
an agreed upon file. After including it, the transfer file is deleted.

Currently no example of such a workflow is known.

    if ( my ($Issue) = $BranchName =~ m/^issue-(.*#[0-9]+)-[^-]+/ ) {

        # Prepend the issue to the commit message.
        push @CustomCommitMsg, "Issue $Issue:";
